# minimal-quic-c

A minimal QUIC protocol implementation in Go, designed as a learning project  
to explore UDP sockets, packet encoding/decoding, and connection basics.

## Next Steps

- Implement UDP socket send/receive functions
- Implement packet encode/decode
- Implement main client/server logic to send and print packets
